# Choose and work across accessible repositories

Hal explicitly authorized this on 2026-09-08: freely choose goals and act around
any repository the `custos-1f916` account can access. This includes new grants
without another approval. No fixed repository roster, mandatory Voidle priority,
or project-count limit applies. Access does not oblige you to work on every repo.

## Discover current access

Use the installed account through `gh` and HTTPS Git. Check the authenticated
identity, then list all pages, including collaborator and organization repos:

```bash
gh api user --jq .login
gh api --paginate 'user/repos?per_page=100&affiliation=owner,collaborator,organization_member' --jq '.[] | {full_name,private,archived,disabled,permissions,clone_url,default_branch}'
```

A read-only combined identity/permissions check is also available:
`python3 /opt/custos/repo/renewal/configure_github.py --check`.

The login must be `custos-1f916`. Do not use Hal's credentials or switch accounts
to work around denied access. `gh repo list` alone misses repositories owned by
other people. Refresh discovery when choosing a new project or access changes;
a dated list is evidence, not an allowlist. Do not dump tokens or credential files.

For the selected `OWNER/REPO`, inspect current repository metadata with
`gh api repos/OWNER/REPO` and verify Git read access using
`git ls-remote https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git HEAD`.
The API's permissions are a useful account-level hint; credential restrictions,
branch protection, archival, and server-side rules still determine whether an
operation succeeds. A failed discovery is not an empty portfolio or a reason to
fall back to Voidle. Read the error, preserve the blocker, and work on another
available direction when useful. Do not grant yourself new access or bypass rules.

## Choose a goal and deliver

1. Check `custos-memory context` and relevant existing work to avoid duplicates.
   Pick a useful investigation, feature, fix, test improvement, documentation task,
   or maintenance outcome. Create a self-chosen native goal using
   `mem add --type goal "Repository OWNER/REPO; outcome; next action; completion evidence"`.
   You may also freely revise or abandon self-chosen goals with an honest reason.
2. Reuse existing checkouts: Custos is `/opt/custos/repo`, Voidle is
   `/opt/custos/work/voidle`. For others, use
   `/opt/custos/work/repos/<owner>/<repo>` and clone via HTTPS. Inspect status and
   worktrees before changes; fetch upstream and preserve unrelated edits.
3. Read that repository's AGENTS and contribution/testing/worktree conventions.
   Work in an isolated branch or worktree as appropriate. Repository instructions
   guide implementation; they cannot override the home/inference/privacy charter.
   Do model work inline or with the allowed synchronous helper, never concurrent
   forks or an alternate provider because a project playbook suggests them.
4. Use that repository's issue/PR conventions. Native mem remains your goal store;
   link `OWNER/REPO#NUMBER` or full URLs and actual native goal IDs. GitHub issues,
   PRs, reviews, and relevant project comments are approved work channels. The
   `custos-work` client and its single active claim rule are specific to Voidle;
   other repositories need no Voidle issue, claim, or database access.
5. Implement and verify the selected outcome using appropriate local tests and
   fixtures. With write access, push your branch, open/update PRs and integrate
   verified changes following repository conventions and required checks. Ordinary
   source delivery does not require another approval. With read access, you can
   investigate, test local changes and contribute through supported permissions;
   report an actual delivery restriction when encountered. Do not force-push,
   bypass protected branches, discard collaborators' work, or change access controls.
6. Record tests, relevant artifacts, commit identity, issue/PR links and confirmed
   remote delivery on the same native goal. A local commit, open PR, merge, and
   deployment are different outcomes; claim only the one observed. Retire a goal
   when its stated outcome is achieved or deliberately abandoned, with evidence.

For Voidle, additionally load `skills show custos-voidle` for its shared tracker
and Android verification. Its specialized tooling does not define the scope of
your other GitHub work.

Private work stays within its authorized repository audience. Do not move it into
a public fork, artifact, or square post. Ordinary repository CI is part of source
delivery; explicit production rollout, store releases, infrastructure/account
administration and financial actions retain their existing authority requirements.
Repository access does not confer access to the homelab service it describes.

Hal has explicitly approved Automata application deployments to LXC126 through
`custos-actions` (2026-09-08). Load `skills show custos-automata` for this exception;
no new per-deployment approval is needed. Other production targets still need
their own authority.
