"""Install root-owned /usr/local/libexec/custos-backend-probe on Johan.

Bind a dedicated SSH public key in user@johan authorized_keys to:
restrict,from="192.168.86.44",command="/usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/libexec/custos-backend-probe" ssh-ed25519 ...
The key grants ONLY this read-only socket snapshot, never a guest shell. No
inference requests, process mutations, credentials, or model content are read.

An established gateway connection from .44 is our request. ALL other peer
addresses are foreign (including local health checks). Other blink1 clients
using .44 are indistinguishable: deploy them through a distinct source IP or the
same arbiter. Socket observations are not engine-idle proof: disconnected work
may briefly drain; cancellation is cooperative, never hard GPU preemption.
